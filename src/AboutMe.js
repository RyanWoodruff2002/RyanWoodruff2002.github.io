            <p>
                My name is Ryan Woodruff, and I am a full-stack developer. To create web apps I use a React front-end with a Ruby on Rails back-end. I am currently in phase-4 of 5 in Flatiron's software engineering program. After graduating high school I pursed a computer science degree at Jamestown Community College. During my sophmore year I decided to stop persuing a college education for the faster-paced education a bootcamp provides. After some careful consideration I decided Flatiron was the best choice for me. Since enrolling at Flatiron I have learned; JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
