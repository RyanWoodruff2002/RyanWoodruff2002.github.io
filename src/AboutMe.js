                My name is Ryan Woodruff, and I am a full-stack developer. To create web apps I use a JavaScript and React front-end with a Ruby on Rails back-end. I recently graduated from Flatiron's software engineering program. After graduating high school I pursued a computer science degree at Jamestown Community College. During my sophmore year I decided to stop persuing a college education for the faster-paced education a bootcamp provides. After some careful consideration I decided Flatiron was the best choice for me. During my time at Flatiron I learned; JavaScript, React, Ruby, SQLite, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. I have experience working with a team and alone on several projects. My goal now that I have graduated is to continue learning and getting exposure to new technologies.
