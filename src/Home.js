                    I recently graduated from Flatiron's software engineering program. I create web apps using a JavaScript and React front-end with a Ruby on Rails back-end. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    After graduating high school I pursued a computer science degree at Jamestown Community College. From there I decided to further my education with a faster-paced bootcamp. After some careful consideration I decided Flatiron was the best choice for me.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    During my time at Jamestown Community College I learned Python, Java, computer hardware & system software, intro to networking, data structures, systems analysis, and database management.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    During my time at Flatiron I worked on several projects as a team and as an individual where I learned; JavaScript, React, Ruby, SQLite, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                    My goal now is to continue growing and learning new technologies through a career as a full stack developer.
